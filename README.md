# Pathfinding Visualizer

## Python and Pygame

In this project, I built a pathfinding visualizer that allows the user to create their own mazes and visualize the following algorithms:
Dijkstra's algorithm, A\* algorithm, Breadth First Search and Depth First Search

To run the program you will have to have pygame installed in your machine.

To do so, type: "pip install pygame" into the terminal.

This is a test.
